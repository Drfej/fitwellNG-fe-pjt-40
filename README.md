Project Summary
Fitwell App is a Wellness app for everyone; it covers the Nutritional diet and physical wellness of an individual. 
The app is centered on the physical wellness of a person and the daily consumption of a well-balanced diet.

What is a balanced diet?
A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. To get the nutrition you need, most of your daily calories should come from:
•	fresh fruits
•	fresh vegetables
•	whole grains
•	legumes
•	nuts
•	lean proteins

A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance.
Your body needs nutrients to stay healthy, and food supplies essential nutrients that stop us from getting sick.
Calories are a measure of energy that foods supply. The number of calories you need will depend on your sex, age, and activity level.
